    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international 
        cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national 
        cricket team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen
        in the history of the sport, he plays for 
        Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and Delhi in 
        domestic cricket. Kohli holds numerous records in his 
        career which includes scoring most runs in T20 internationals 
        and IPL, fastest to reach 10,000 ODI runs. 
        In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the 
        male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed 
        to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup 
        and the 2013 Champions trophy. He is among the only four 
        Indian cricketers who has played 500 matches for India.

        Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the 
        West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career 
        with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut 
        in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team 
        and later made his Test debut in 2011.

    <p class="para">
        In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the 
        ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. 
        During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the 
        most runs scored in the tournament. 
        In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, 
        becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, 
        making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the 
        number one spot in all three formats of the game. 
        His form continued in 2019, when he became the 
        first player to score 20,000 international runs 
        in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision 
        to step down as the captain of the Indian national team
         for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022
          he stepped down as the captain of the Test 
          team as well.
